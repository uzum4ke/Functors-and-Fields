>A map of $\infty$-groupoids $f: X \to Y$ is a **monomorphism**  if its fibers are $(-1)$-groupoids. Equivalently it is fully faithful as a functor:  $Hom_{X}(x, x') \to Hom_{Y}(f(x), f(x'))$ is an equivalence. Explicitly this means
- $f^{-1}(y)$ is either empty or is a connected groupoid.


$\textcolor{orange}{Recall:}$ A $(-1)$-groupoids is the same thing as a truth value: up to equivalence the only $(-1)$-groupoids are the empty groupoid and the contractible groupoid.

$\textcolor{red}{Warning:}$ Diagonal maps $X \to X \times X$ of $\infty$-groupoids are not in general monomorphism, where as diagonal maps of sets are always monomorphisms. *It can be shown* that a diagonal map of $\infty$-groupoids $X \to X \times X$ is a monomorphism iff X is *discrete* (i.e. equivalent to a set).
