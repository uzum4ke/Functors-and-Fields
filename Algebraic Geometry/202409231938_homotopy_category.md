>[!definition]  
>Let $1-Cat$ denote the $(\infty, 2)$-category of $(\infty, 1)$-categories. The full subcategory of $1-Cat$ formed by *ordinary* categories is denoted by $1-Cat_{ordn}$.  This inclusion admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C} \mapsto \mathcal{C}^{ordn}$. This map is usually denoted by $Ho: 1-Cat \to 1-Cat^{ordn}$ and the object $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ is called the **homotopy category** of $\mathcal{C}$. The homotopy category of $\mathcal{C} \in 1-Cat$ has the same objects and its hom-sets are defined as $$Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(x, y) : \equiv \pi_{0}(Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(x, y)).$$

$\textcolor{red}{Warning:}$ $1-Cat_{ordn}$ is a $(2, 1)$-category consisting of categories, functors and natural transformations, where as $(1-Cat)^{ordn} :\equiv Ho(1-Cat)$ is a $1-$category consisting of categories and functors.
